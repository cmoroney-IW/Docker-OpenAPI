# OpenAPI Generator in Docker

## Install

- Clone this repository into a local directory
- Open a terminal in the directory and run `docker-compose up`
- Wait for the build to complete - it can be lengthy

## Testing

- Once the build is complete and the app is running, open a browser and enter `localhost:8080`
- This should display Swagger documentation of the endpoints within the API
- Open Postman and use the collection JSON file in the directory to test that the GET endpoints within the API are running correctly
